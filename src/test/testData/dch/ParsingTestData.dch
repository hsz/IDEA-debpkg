    "update-initramfs -u", which had the same affect).

  * dh_installman: Improve error messages and handling of broken
    section numbers.  Notably, the auto-detection no longer picks
    section numbers that look suspiciously like a version number

debhelper (12.5.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Skip compat call if d/control cannot be found
    and just assume that auto-abbreviation can be disabled in that
    case.  This avoids breaking options such as --help and --list.
    (Closes: #935017)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Jump to hoops to only parse the Build-Dependency
    field in dh without breaking dh's own --list or --help
    parameter.  This fixes a regression since 12.5 where dh's
    --help and --list options were broken.
  * dh_builddeb: Revert removal of --destdir for now.  It is in
    fact used to hardcode paths in some cases e.g. v4l2loopback's
    debian/rules.modules.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Disable auto-filtering of udeb libraries.  It
    cannot be implemented without violating the requirements for
    the noudeb build-profile.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Fix invalid error under the noudeb profile
    where the absence of udeb content is expected rather than an
    in issue.  (Closes: #934999)

debhelper (12.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_makeshlibs: Fix regression in compat 10 and earlier where
    dh_makeshlibs now failed on error.  This safety check was
    intended to be a compat 11 or later feature.
  * dh: Ensure addon API functions return 1 to avoid gratuitous
    breakage of addons due to perl's idiosyncrasy of requiring a
    truth value at the end of modules.  (See #935016)

debhelper (12.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdeb: Allow "+" to appear in token names as it is
    a valid character for package names.
  * dh_installdeb: Reject invalid token names passed to -D or
    --define (in most cases).
  * dh_makeshlibs: Fix bug in -X where it would no longer match
    as expected.  A regression since 12.5 - thanks to  Aurelien
    Jarno for reporting the issue over IRC.

debhelper (12.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * dh_strip: Skip stripping of guile-2.2 files by skipping all
    all files matching "/guile/.*\.go$".  Thanks to Jeremy Bicha
    and Rob Browning.  (Closes: #907061)
  * dh_auto_*: Officially adopt --sourcedir and --builddir as official
    parameters.  They have always worked since debhelper defaulted to
    supporting auto-abbreviated parameters, so this is simply documenting
    fait accompli for the most common abbreviation.
  * dh_*: Disable auto-abbreviation of command line parameters in compat
    13.
  * dh: Optimize out redundant helpers even when passed long options in
    compat 13.
  * dh_builddeb: Remove --destdir.  It has never been useful as everyone
    expects the debs to be placed in "..".
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Add a hint to resolve the error caused by having the
    compat level specified both as a build-dependency and in
    debian/compat.  Thanks to Alessandro Grassi for reporting the issue
    on IRC.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Fix bug where --no-add-udeb could trigger the
    auto-detection code.  (Closes: #934891)
  * dh_makeshlibs: When using the auto-detection of udeb, automatically
    exclude "udeb:" lines for libraries omitted from the udeb.  At the
    same time, verbosely fail if the udeb contains a library not present
    in the deb (overridable with --add-udeb).  (Closes: #934889)
  * dh: Support making "dh-sequence-ADDON" Build-Depends relation
    conditional on build-profiles (etc.).  If the relation is ignored due
    to the current build-profiles (etc.), then addon is silently skipped.
  * dh: Support running addons in "arch-only" or "indep-only" mode by
    adding "dh-sequence-ADDON" in Build-Depends-Arch or
    Build-Depends-Indep (respectively).  Not all addons support this and
    will trigger an error at load time.  Addon providers should ensure
    that their package provide "dh-sequence-ADDON" and review the
    doc/PROGRAMMING document (in the debhelper source) if they are
    considering to make their addon compatible with these requirements.
    (Closes: #836699)
  * dh,elf_tools.pm: Extract the ELF related debhelper tools (dh_strip,
    dh_dwz, dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps) into their own addon called
    "elf-tools" enabled by the default.
  * debian/control: Provide dh-sequence-elf-tools.
  * dh: In compat 13, the "elf-tools" addon is considered an implicit
    "arch-only" addon (i.e. they are only available in "-arch" sequences
    and are always passed a "-a").  If you need the ELF tools for arch:all
    packages, please add an explicit Builds-Depends on dh-sequence-elf-tools.

  [ Frank Schaefer ]
  * dh_installmodules: Also look for compressed kernel modules
    in addition to uncompressed kernel modules (gz, bz2 or xz).

  [ Adam Borowski ]
  * d/s/lintian-overrides: Override lintian warning about debhelper
    not using debhelper.

debhelper (12.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh: Retroactively remove support for manual dh sequence
    operators (--until, --after, --before and --remaining).
    This breaks about 8 source packages that still rely on this
    feature and have not yet migrated away.  (Closes: #932537)

    package names.

  * Update Portuguese translation (Américo Monteiro)  (Closes: #927394)

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * dh_installsystemduser: Fix bug that would neuter sorting of unit
    files and make the resulting maintscripts unreproducible.  Thanks
    to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for reporting the bug.  (Closes: #932646)
  * dh_dwz: Remove the -q flag when calling dwz(1).  It is
    sufficiently silently with -q and aids with debugging for others.
    (Closes: #933561, #931792)
  * dh_dwz: Gracefully handle when dwz fails to create a multifile
    but succeeds anyway by default.  The previous behaviour of
    insisting on a multifile can be obtained by explicitly passing
    --dwz-multifile.  (Closes: #933541)
  * dh_dwz: Skip multifile generation for udeb packages.
    (Closes: #933212)
  * dh_makeshlibs: Attempt to automatically detect udeb packages
    for a given (non-udeb) library package.  In simple cases, it
    can replace the need for an explicit --add-udeb parameter.
    However, there are many cases where the auto-detection falls
    short and --add-udeb is still needed (see dh_makeshlibs(1)
    for details).  Packagers are advised to verify the resulting
    shlibs file before removing --add-udeb in an upload.

    Reopens: #462389)
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Produce a better error message when -p<pkg> is
    ignored in an architecture constrained override (e.g. during an
    architecture specific build and the -p argument refers to an
    arch:all package).  Thanks to Helmut Grohne for reporting the

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Ensure the error function always triggers the same
    exit code on termination.  Previously, it depended on the
    value of the last error (if any).
  * Buildsystem/make: Fix regression where cross-flags were
    passed in a non-cross build.  (Closes: #925175)
  * dh_perl: Fix code to prune (skip) /usr/share/doc which
    never worked.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: Document that the environment variable
    DH_AUTOSCRIPTDIR can be used for testing purposes to
    shadow existing or test new autoscript snippets.  Thanks
    to Dmitry Bogatov for the suggestion.  (Closes: #925281)
  * dh_compress: Exclude .haddock and .hs files (as this is
    customary for haskell packages).
  * dh_installinfo: Update NOOP PROMISE to account for
    dh_missing's needs.  Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for
    reporting the issue.  (Closes: #930689)
  * debhelper.pod: Document that debhelper will use
    dpkg-buildflags for setting CFLAGS et al and that it is
    recommended to rely on dpkg-buildflags's features for
    extending the default.  (Closes: #923626)
  * dh_strip: Make dh_strip more robust with issues from
    file(1).  Thanks to Christoph Biedl for reporting the
    issue.  (Closes: #931995)
  * dh_shlibdeps: Pass --brief to file(1) and anchor the
    output parsing regex to avoid false-positive
    misdetections.  Thanks to Christoph Biedl for the
    suggestion.  (Closes: #931996)
  * dh_strip: Ditto.
  * dh_installman: Improve documentation to be more clear
    about exactly which new features dh_installman got in
    compat 11.  Thanks to Laurent Bigonville for pointing
    out the issue.  (Closes: #912999)
  * dh_strip: Pass --no-sandbox to file(1) when run under
    fakeroot and file(1) appear to support the option.
    Thanks to Christoph Biedl for requesting the feature.
    (Closes: #932006)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Support substituting additional variables
    into the generated maintainer scripts.  These include
    DEB_(BUILD|HOST|TARGET)_* and ENV.* which point to the
    variables from dpkg-architecture(1) and variables from
    the environment (respectively).
  * dh_installdeb: Support additional substitution variables
    on the commandline via -DTOKEN=VALUE to replace #TOKEN#
