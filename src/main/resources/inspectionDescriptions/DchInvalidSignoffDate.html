<p>Detects when the sign-off date is invalid or uses the wrong format.</p>
<p>
   The date format used in the Debian changelog format has a strict format based on RFC 822
   (e.g. Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:30:50 +0000).  This inspection detects sign-off dates does not
   follow that format or where the date itself is invalid.

<p><b>Example of invalid date that are detected</b></p>
<br>
<pre>
 -- John Doe &lt;john@example.com&gt;  Thu, 04 Mar 2019 15:9:47 +0200
</pre>
<br>
<p>The correct line would be:</p>
<br>
<pre>
 -- John Doe &lt;john@example.com&gt;  Mon, 04 Mar 2019 15:09:47 +0200
</pre>
<br>
<p>
As noted there are two corrections. One, the minute is specified with two digits as
required and two, the day name (Thu) is corrected to (Mon) as 2019-03-04 was a Monday.
</p>
<br>
<b>Why are single digit dates not detected?</b>
<p>This detection "forgives" single digit dates if that is the only issue in the date.  This is because
that variant is prevalent in very old changelog entries (e.g. 2005 and earlier).  However, the quickfix
(where available) always uses the two-digit dates - even when it is used to correct older dates.</p>
