<p>Detects packages with possibly wrong architecture based on the name</p>
<p>
    This inspection relies on common patterns in package names to detect possible inconsistencies
    between Architecture field and the "guessed" architecture (based on the package name).  Examples
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Packages ending with -doc or -docs tends to be documentation packages and should be architecture independent.</li>
    <li>Packages named "aspell-&lt;lang&gt;" (and similar) is a common naming convention for words lists to aspell and should be architecture independent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that this inspection can sometimes be a hint that something else is wrong.  If you find yourself with a package that contains architecture dependent
    binaries in a package that triggers this warning, then perhaps the naming is in correct, the contents should be split differently, or (for doc packages)
    you should not include pre-compiled example code.
</p>

<p>
    The heuristics do not apply to naming conventions that have common known exceptions. As an example, packages following "lib*-perl" convention can both be
    architecture dependent if they are implemented as an XS module (C-code). While it is "rare" compared to the number of "pure perl" modules, it is common
    enough that this inspection does not emit warnings for that (and other programming language specific patterns).
