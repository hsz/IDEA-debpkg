<p>Detects non-standard Build-Profiles</p>
<p>
    Debian maintains a list of standardized Build-Profiles to be used in build dependency fields and the
    <tt>Build-Profiles</tt> field. In addition to these, any source package can declare custom build profiles
    of the format <tt>pkg.&lt;source&gt;.&lt;name&gt;</tt>, which are also considered valid by this inspection.
</p>
<p>
    Please review <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BuildProfileSpec">https://wiki.debian.org/BuildProfileSpec</a>
    for a description of what the Build-Profiles mean.
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p><b>Limitation</b>: Currently, only the Build-Profiles fields is checked. This will hopefully be fixed in a later version.</p>
