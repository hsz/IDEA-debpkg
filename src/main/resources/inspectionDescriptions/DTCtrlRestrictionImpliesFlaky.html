<p>Detects possible missing "flaky" restriction</p>
<p>
    All tests in <var>debian/tests/control</var> that can randomly fail must be declared as
    <var>flaky</var>.  This inspection detects if a test is not declared as <var>flaky</var>,
    but seems like it ought to have been based on other metadata (such as needing internet
    access, since internet access is never 100% reliable).
