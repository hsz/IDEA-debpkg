<p>Detects mutually exclusive test fields</p>
<p>
    Each paragraph in <var>debian/tests/control</var> must use exactly one of <var>Tests</var> or
    <var>Test-Command</var>. This inspection detects when both are present in the same paragraph
    and provides quick fixes to remove either of them.
