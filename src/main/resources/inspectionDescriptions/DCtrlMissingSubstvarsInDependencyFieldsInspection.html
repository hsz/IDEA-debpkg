<p>Detects possibly missing substvars in dependency fields of package paragraphs in debian/control</p>
<p>
    The package paragraphs in <tt>debian/control</tt> should almost always have a dependency on a substitution
    variable like <tt>${shlibs:Depends}</tt> for architecture dependent packages.  This inspection reports some
    of these potentially missing substvars.
</p>

<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    Limitations: Currently this inspection only covers the <tt>${shlibs:Depends}</tt> substvars for now.  The
    debhelper related substvars ${misc:Depends} and ${misc:Pre-Depends} are not covered yet.
