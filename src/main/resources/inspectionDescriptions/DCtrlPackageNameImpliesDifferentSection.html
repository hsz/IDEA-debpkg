<p>Detects packages with possibly wrong section based on the name</p>
<p>
    This inspection relies on common patterns in package names to detect possible inconsistencies
    between Section field and the "guessed" architecture (based on the package name).  Examples
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Packages ending with -doc or -docs tends to be documentation packages and should have section be "doc".</li>
    <li>Packages named "aspell-&lt;lang&gt;" (and similar) is a common naming convention for words lists to aspell and should have section "localization".</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The inspection provides a quick fix to update the section to the expected value, where it can reliably determine the correct replacement for the section value.
