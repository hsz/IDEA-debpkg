<p>Detects when a field duplicates the value from the source paragraph.</p>
<p>
    In the <tt>debian/control</tt> file, the <b>Package</b> paragraphs inherits the value of fields from
    the <b>Source</b> paragraph where relevant.  That implies that it is redundant to repeat the field
    in the <b>Package</b> if it contains the exact same value as the Source paragraph.  This warning
    can serve to help you prune such redundant declaration or help you identify when a field incorrectly
    shares the same content as the <b>Source</b> paragraph.

<pre>
Source: debhelper
Section: misc
Priority: optional
#...

Package: debhelper
# Overrides the previous Section value
Section: devel
# Unnecessary and just repeats the the above.  This would trip the warning.
