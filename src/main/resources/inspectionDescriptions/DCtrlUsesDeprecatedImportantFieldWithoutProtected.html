<p>Detects usage of <tt>XB-Important: yes</tt> without <tt>Protected: yes</tt>.</p>
<p>
    Finds usages of the <tt>XB-Important</tt> field that is not paired with a field <tt>Protected</tt>.
    The <tt>Protected</tt> is supported in both APT and dpkg, whereas <tt>XB-Important</tt> is only
    supported APT.  Accordingly, <tt>Protected</tt> will provide better coverage provided the package
    is installed on a system with a new enough version of APT and dpkg.
