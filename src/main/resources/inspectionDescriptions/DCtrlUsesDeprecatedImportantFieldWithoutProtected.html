<p>Detects usage of "Important: yes" without "Protected: yes".
    Finds usages of the "Important" field that is not paired with a field "Protected".  The "Protected"
    is supported in both APT and dpkg, whereas "Important" is only supported APT.  Accordingly,
    "Protected" will provide better coverage provided the package is installed on a system with a
    new enough version of APT and dpkg.
